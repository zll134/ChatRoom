static const char *g_long_str = "The Wood River Branch Railroad was a shortline railroad "
"in Rhode Island, United States. Chartered in 1872 and opened on July 1, 1874, the 5.6-mile "
"(9.0 km) line connected Hope Valley, Rhode Island, to the New York, Providence and Boston "
"Railroad (known as the Stonington Line) mainline at Wood River Junction. Though always "
"nominally independent, the company was closely affiliated with the Stonington Line and "
"its successor, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (the New Haven), which held "
"significant portions of its stock. \n"
"The Wood River Branch carried both passengers and freight for local mills and other industries. "
"A small operation, the company owned only one or two locomotives at any given time. Rhode Island "
"citizen Ralph C. Watrous became president of the railroad in 1904, and remained involved in its "
"operation for the next 33 years. He defended the railroad from several attempts at abandonment. "
"A major flood in November 1927 severed the line and suspended all operations. The company "
"considered abandonment, but ultimately local citizens and the New Haven agreed to rebuild the "
"damaged segments and return the line to service for freight only, using a gasoline locomotive.\n"
"Abandonment was considered again in 1937, but the New Haven instead agreed to sell the line for "
"$301 to businessman Roy Rawlings, owner of a grain mill that was the line's biggest customer. "
"He ran the company with his family and a small staff until 1947. That year, both his mill and "
"two other Hope Valley industries were destroyed by fire. Lacking enough business to justify "
"operating expenses, the railroad ceased operations and was abandoned in its entirety in August "
"1947. Little of the line remains as of 2018.\n"
"History\n"
"Southern Rhode Island's first railroad was the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad "
"(commonly known as the Stonington Line or simply the Stonington), which opened between "
"Providence and Stonington, Connecticut, in 1837, connecting to New York City via steamboat."
"[2] The arrival of rail transportation allowed major growth in textile mills, which used water"
" power along local rivers, such as the Pawcatuck River.[3] Mill owners found that transportation"
"over land by wagon was costly in both time and money. In the mid-1860s, Harris Lanphear, "
"owner of several mills on the Wood River (a tributary of the Pawcatuck), found that it "
"cost three times as much to transport goods to Stonington than it did to ship them the "
"rest of the way to New York. He and other local residents realized that a railroad would "
"solve this problem.\n"
"The largest local manufacturer was the Nichols and Langworthy Machine Company, formed in 1834"
" at the site of the Crandall Mill. The mill was previously purchased by Gardner Nichols and "
"Russel Thayer in 1824, at which time they first introduced the name Hope Valley. The Machine "
"Company was created by Nichols along with Joshua and Joseph Langworthy, all of whom were later "
"succeeded by Gardner Nichols' son Amos G. Nichols and with his brother Henry G. Nichols. By "
"the 1860s, Nichols and Langworthy had expanded into the production of boilers, steam engines, "
"textile machinery, and printing presses\n"
"Formation and construction\n"
"Residents in the Hope Valley area first asked the Stonington to build a branch to serve "
"local mills, but they were among many towns and cities along the Stonington's route that "
"also desired branches, and the Stonington's management had no interest in building any "
"branches regardless.[4] The residents next chartered their own new railroad, the Wood "
"River Railroad, in January 1867. The new company was authorized to raise up to $600,000 "
"(equivalent to $11,600,000 in 2021) to complete a route from Wood River Junction (at "
"the time known as Richmond Switch) on the Stonington Line to Greene on the Hartford, "
"Providence and Fishkill Railroad (HP&F). It was also given the authority to merge with "
"either of its connections after completing construction. The route was approximately 21"
" miles (34 km) and passed through generally hilly terrain, serving no major population "
"centers; in fact, the promoters of the company had no intention of actually building a "
"railroad. Their goal was to entice one of the proposed line's connections to intervene "
"and build the line for them, a tactic that had succeeded elsewhere in the United States. "
"The Stonington maintained its refusal to build branches, and while the HP&F built several "
"short branches elsewhere, it had no interest in building one in southern Rhode Island.[4] "
"Without the resources of a larger railroad, no progress was made and the charter expired "
"five years later.[4]\n"
"Once the first charter expired, residents in the area sought out a new charter, this time "
"intending to build the railroad themselves.[6] The Wood River Branch Railroad was chartered "
"in May 1872, along an approximately seven-mile (11 km) route beginning at Richmond Switch "
"and ending in Hope Valley. The exact terminus location was not specified;[6] the Hope Valley "
"villages of Locustville and Wyoming both sought to have the railroad's terminus. To choose "
"a route, the railroad's directors arranged for all stock subscriptions to be sorted into "
"three groups: those who wanted a Wyoming terminus, those who wanted a Locustville terminus, "
"and those who had no preference. By May 20, 172 shares had been pledged, including 50 for "
"Locustville and 20 for Wyoming, with the remainder expressing no preference. The directors "
"voted that the company's terminus would be Locustville if $35,000 (equivalent to $792,000 "
"in 2021) were raised, but Wyoming instead if either $45,000 (equivalent to $1,018,000 in "
"2021) were raised or those in favor of Wyoming pledged a total of $10,000 (equivalent to "
"$226,000 in 2021).[6]\n"
"A survey was started under the direction of George T. Lanphear on July 17, 1872, and "
"completed on August 2. Lanphear identified two routes from Richmond Switch to Locustville. "
"The western alignment would cost $10,000 more, but would serve two additional mills in "
"Woodville. To extend the line from Locustville to Wyoming would cost approximately an "
"additional $23,000 (equivalent to $520,000 in 2021).[6]\n"
"While progress had been made on raising funds, development of the railroad was impaired "
"by both the Panic of 1873 and a deadly train derailment on the Stonington Line at Richmond "
"Switch, caused by the washout of a railroad bridge by a dam collapse.[7][8] Most subscribers "
"to the Wood River Branch's stock reduced their subscriptions accordingly, and one mill owner's "
"pledge to buy 101 shares was wiped out with his death.[9] The company was saved when on June "
"23, 1873, the Stonington Line finally decided to get involved and pledged $19,000, plus "
"$1,000 worth of pledges made directly by that company's executives (equivalent to $430,000 "
"and $23,000 in 2021, respectively).[10] At this point, the Wood River Branch had $59,500 "
"(equivalent to $1,346,000 in 2021) of subscribed stock, which was barely sufficient to "
"reach Locustville, let alone Wyoming. The latter was excluded from the final route, much "
"to the anger of Wyoming residents.[10]\n"
"Construction of the line began on September 20, 1873, with a $95,500 (equivalent to $2,160,000 "
"in 2021) contract awarded to J.B. Dacey & Co. to build the entire line. After delays caused "
"by winter weather, construction was completed between Wood River Junction and Woodville "
"by April 1874.[11] Acquisition of a locomotive and rolling stock fell to board member "
"Amos G. Nichols, who ordered a new 4-4-0 steam locomotive, named the Gardner Nichols "
"after his father. With the branch out of money, Nichols purchased the locomotive from "
"the Rhode Island Locomotive Works himself for $8,500 (equivalent to $204,000 in 2021). "
"Nichols also purchased a new passenger car from the Worcester-based Osgood Bradley Car "
"Company using $4,500 (equivalent to $108,000 in 2021) of Wood River Branch Railroad bonds "
"instead of cash. There was no money left for a baggage car.[12] The line opened for "
"business on July 1, 1874.[13]";
